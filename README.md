# The Feedback Repo for the The Imposter's Handbook, Season 2

Welcome, and thanks for dropping by. This is the feedback and code repository for Big Machine's [The Imposter's Handbook, Season 2](https://bigmachine.io/projects/imposters-handbook-presale/). We're actively writing this book and altering the code you see here, so if you see any issues in the book or the code, please pop them in the issues list.

## Organization

The code is organized by chapter (03, 06, etc) and within each chapter directory is a file that corresponds to a section of code within the book. I wanted to try to keep examples together so they made sense.


## Changelog

We'll document the changes to the book and code here, as well as in the book itself.
